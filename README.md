I created this for scaffolding a Single Page App with some default features below.

- Scroll snap style, both horizontally and vertically snap into place when scroll
- Installable, set as home screen will behave like an app
- Offline-able, once installed no internet needed, service worker will serve content
- Full screen with double click
